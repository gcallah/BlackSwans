Columbia Street, Brooklyn, 1978 
</p>

<p>
This area had one been a thriving commercial district, bustling with shoppers
and busy stores. 
</p>

<p>
However, in the 1950s, Robert Moses blasted the BQE through the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
By 1978
all the Italian americans that made up this community had left for better lives
in the suburbs.
It became the crack capital of the United States.
Windswept streets littered with plastic bags beer cans, huge piles of junk and garbage
dumped on the sidewalks, burnt-out cars and abandoned buildings characterized
the area at that time.
</p>

<p>
This was the moment Tony's father chose to buck the trend and move back. He
bought several abandoned buildings for pennies and opened a repair shop.
</p>

<p>
Ten-year-old Tony walking down the street of his new home was accosted by two
slightly older Latino boys. 
</p>

<p>
They were members of the local gang, the VIL.
</p>

<p>
They
stood in Tony's way, saying that they needed to beat up all white boys on
this side of the tracks, and proceeded to beat him. 
</p>

<p>
For years Tony slunk by, mostly staying inside, only venturing out with
great fear. He learned to watch the shadows that the street lights cast before
him, as it would give him valuable seconds notice before a VIL member jumped
him.  They stole his sneakers, his roller skates, and his bicycle.
They held unforgiving knives to the soft white skin of his throat. 
</p>

<p>
One day
while held up in the top floor hall of a tenament building with his best
friend, a Mexican named Jose. Jose had kissed a VIL member's girlfriend.
They were after Jose and Tony was now guilty not just of being "white" (if a
dark-skinned Southern Italian boy really was "white") but also guilt by
association..
</p>

<p>
While discussing their predicament Jose says to <b>Tony</b>:
</p>

<p>
<b>J</b>: You dont need to be scared of them.<br>
<b>T</b>: Huh? Why?<br>
<b>J</b>: You're Italian, Tony, the Italians are the toughest, they have the biggest
gang. 
</p>

    Upper East Side,
near Central Park. Camera pans over uniformed doormen in front of brownstones,
ladies walking manicured poodles, the Park, with a slow drizzle falling. We
slowly focus in on an elegant doorway, containing a woman holding the door
open. Just past the door, on the sidewalk, is a man with a suitcase in hand.]</a>
</p>

<p>

waiting. You'd better get going.
</p>

<p>
<b>Chester</b>: Molly, you really want me to
go?
</p>

<p>
<b>Molly</b>: Chester, get in the damned car.
</p>

<p>
<b>Chester</b>: But the kids! 
</p>

<p>
<b>Molly</b>: The kids will get along without
you snoring all hungover on the couch, I believe. But if you think differently,
we could talk to my lawyers about this, again. Do you really want that?
</p>

<p>
[Chester slouches away to waiting car.
We get his view, out the window, as he leaves the Upper East Side and gets on
the FDR. View across the river to outer boroughs. Views crossing the Brooklyn
Bridge. Car gets off highway onto Columbia Street. Chester staring out window
at cranes by docks, live poultry shop. Gets out of car, goes to brownstone and
rings bell. The door is opened by a man, obviously very gay and obviously very
drunk.]

<p>

Chester, my lieutenant. [Giggles.] Oh, my, I mean my new tenant. Come in, come
in. Let me show you the place.
</p>

<p>
[Mel weaves his way up the stairs to
the third floor. He shows Chester the small, dingy one bedroom. He moves to the
kitchen window.]
</p>

<p>
<b>M</b>: And look at this [he tugs up the
venetian blinds], you have a view of Manhattan! [Gestures out window. Chester
notices the blind cord has become wrapped around Mel's ankle. He points,
worried look on his face, but his pointing, in fact, prompts Mel to take a step
forward, and the cord brings him down face first onto the floor.]
</p>

<p>
<b>M</b>: Oopsie! [Picks himself up.] Well,
what do you think?
</p>

<p>
<b>C</b>: It'll do.

Chester moves to window and stares wistfully across the river at Manhattan.]

[He turns into a deli. The line is
long, construction workers and plumbers and carpenters by the look of them.
Chester goes to the back. Three hispanic guys are behind the counter, taking
and preparing orders.]

<p>
[<a
name=TonyAndChesterMeet>Chester sits in the corner of &quot;the bar.&quot; (We
must name this place!) He is reading a hardcover book, occasionally pausing to
look around and note the scene.</a>
</p>

<p>
Tony, not
plastered but clearly with a few drinks in him, has been telling stories to a
couple of guys farther down the bar. At some point in his tale-telling, we see
him take note of Chester. A look of curiosity comes across his face. Someone
unfamiliar, doing something odd (reading a book in a packed and noisy bar):
could be amusing to go fuck with him. He finishes the current story.]
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony</b>: Excuse me, I
gotta go say &quot;hello&quot; to my friend in the corner.
</p>

<p>
[His companions
nod. Tony makes his way over to where Chester is sitting, and approaches him
closely enough that he is somewhat inside Chester's space, without actually
making any physical contact.]
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony</b>: So, Mr.
Intellectual, I suppose you're too smart to bother talking to the rest of us
here?
</p>

<p>
<b>Chester</b> [Sets
aside his book and sizes Tony up with curiosity. After a few seconds a slight
smile appears on his face.]: I wouldn't say that. Just been around long enough
not to bother with people who have nothing better to do than hassling strangers
who are minding their own business. [Chester quite deliberately turns away from
Tony and again takes up his book.]
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony</b> [Laughs]:
Touche! [Reaches out his hand.] I'm Tony.
</p>

<p>
<b>Chester</b> [again
setting aside his book]: Chester.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony</b>: What are you
reading?
</p>

<p>
[Chester picks up
his book and shows Tony the cover. The title reads <i>The Fall of the Roman
Empire : A New History of Rome and the Barbarians</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony</b>: Hey, this is
a good one. I just finished it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Chester</b> [Now more
curious -- he had not expected that.]: You read a lot of stuff like this?
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony</b>: I love Roman
history. History in general, in fact, but especially Roman. It's <i>my</i>
history. What are you? [He puts up a hand in a &quot;stop&quot; gesture.] Let
me guess. [He studies Chester for a moment.] Irish, right?
</p>

<p>
<b>Chester</b>: Yeah,
mostly. Some Spanish, too.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony</b> [laughs]: We
were building the aqueducts and the Appian Way when you people were wearing
bear skins and living in mud huts.
</p>

<p>
<b>Chester</b>: Ever
heard of a book called <i>Nero's Reign Reconsidered</i>?
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony</b>: Yeah, in
fact, I read it.
</p>

<p>
<b>C</b>: Well, I wrote
it.
</p>

<p>
<b>T</b>: Get the fuck
out of here. You're Chester Florida? [Chester nods.] I can't believe you had
the balls to write a book defending Nero. You really think he was OK?
</p>

<p>
<b>C</b>: Nah, he was
messed up. But saying that isn't going to get your book any attention, is it?
</p>

<p>
<b>T</b> [laughs]: So,
are you writing something new?
</p>

<p>
<b>C</b>: Well, I've been
working on a book on Sulla for a while. Going kind of slowly.
</p>

<p>
<b>T</b>: Are you going
to defend him, too?
</p>

<p>
<b>C</b>: No, I'm trying
to depict what it was like when the proscriptions were happening.
</p>

<p>
<b>T</b>: Man, that must
have been crazy, never knowing if your name was going up in the Forum the next
day, and then your son or brother was going to be hunting you down for a
bounty. [Tony pauses, and looks down at the floor.] Hey, you like drugs?
</p>

<p>
<b>C</b> [Shakes head back and forth, with eyebrows raised.]:
Why do you think my book is going
slowly, or, for that matter, why my wife kicked me out of the house last year,
and I'm hanging out here?
</p>

<p>
<b>T</b>: OK, go take a
bump from this [surreptitiously hands Chester something below the level of the
bar], and get back here, and we'll talk more history, but with you a little
livelier.
</p>

to the restroom.]

</p>

<p>
[<a
name=CarBrokenInto>As Chester walked down Van Brunt with Tony, the setting sun
left him nearly unable to see.]</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony</b>:
Yeah, I tried dealing blow for about a week. Pot was a lot better. My dealers,
the guys working the bars for me, they were always stupefied--you could take
anything from them, do anything to them. The coke guys were way too mean and
edgy. I gave this one guy, Lewis, who was a wanna-be DJ, $400 of stuff to sell
over the weekend. When I called him on Monday, he's all upset. 'Tony,' he says,
'all my audio gear was stolen from my car on Friday by some kids. The coke was
in one of my tapes, and they got it all.
</p>

<p>
So,
Chester, I went to the bar where I knew this jerk hung out. I found his car and
smashed the shit out of it with a bat. Then I ran inside, and grab his arm from
behind, and I say, &quot;Lewis, those kids were back smashing up your car
again! They just ran around the corner.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Lewis
just stared at me, with this sad, hang-dog look.
</p>

<p>
&quot;Come
on Lewis, we've gotta go get them.&quot;
</p>

<p>
He
shook his head slowly, and said, &quot;No, Tony, that's OK, let 'em go.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony</b>: After that I stuck to pot sales.
I drove my shiny-new turbo TransAm from bar to bar on Friday and Saturday nights.
</p>

<p>
But I wasn't a gangster and when the mob pressed my
partner, the partner gave up my stash.
Then the &quot;boys&quot; invited me and my partner to a barbecue.
</p>

<p>
I went with my partner, and my girlfriend Karen. She had been suspicious of
how I was suddenly as rich as shit, and she vowed to leave me if
the rumors she had heard were true.
</p>

<p>
The other attendees to the barbecue were all
the evidence she needed. She started acting up. [HOW?]
When all the women were cleaning up after the men, I
expected her to join in, but she
refused. So I dumped my plate of half-eaten food on her lap.
</p>

<p>
While taking her home I noticed her ex-boyfriend sitting on a curb, two
beers into a six pack. I stopped the car and said &quot;Shall I drop you
off where I found you?&quot;
</p>

<p>
I returned to the party, not knowing my stash was gone, not knowing my partner
had given him up, not knowing I was in danger... such was my high on
life or maybe when you smoke pot you miss a lot of important shit.
</p>

<p>
One of the gangsters suggested a trip into the city, and being newly
single, I accepted.
As I was getting into the car I noticed a young, thin, Puerto Rican fellow,
someone out of place in this opulent neighborhiood. I took a second look as
the young man passed. It was dark but I thought I saw a screwdriver sticking
out of his pocket.
</p>

<p>
I jumped in the Lincoln town car with Mario driving and my partner Joey sitting
in the rear. We went out, painted the town, tied on a good one, made a night of
it... all them cliches.
</p>

<p>
On the way back, Marion pulled into a quiet street, 
and, shocking the crap out of me, suddenly fists flew at me from the front
and back seats.
</p>

<p>
"You think you can do whatever you want, huh?"
As they smacked me around, they taunted me:
"There you go motherfucker!!"
</p>

<p>
I made a second of eye contact with my partner during the beating, a look I
will never forget.
</p>

<p>
I repented, I kowtowed, I made promises, I swore I was out of the drug business
</p>

<p>
Upon my return [TO WHERE?]
my car was gone, my girl was gone, my stash was gone, and I
needed to sell my gold to pay a remaining balance on the stolen stash.
</p>

<p>
From then on, I knew I wanted my businesses to be legit,
and I knew <i>I never wanted a partner again</i>.
</p>


<p>
It was a long slow slog, making money legit.
I spent many evenings with old ladies, 
old men, putting my time in, gaining their trust, 
being rewarded with them holding mortgages on the properties I
purchased.
As soon as I could I evicted the VIL scum that lived in those
buildings. As soon as those properties
were profitable I refinanced and bought more.
</p>

<p>
Very slowly the neighborhood changed, and my investments rose in value.
So, as new yuppie establishments moved into the neighborhood.

</p>

<p><a name=RiccoAtBar>
Chester spotted Ricco as soon as he
entered the bar. Not that doing so was much of an accomplishment – given the
man's shaved head, his protruding goatee, his multiple tattoos, a belly that
looked as if it held a whole, undigested watermelon inside and which was
embellished with a herniated navel that added two inches to its girth, and the
glittering hoops of gold hanging prominently from his ears, Ricco was pretty
easy to spot. He was playing darts towards the rear of the main room, so
Chester ordered a beer, and then wandered past the dartboard, greeting Ricco
and giving him what he hoped was a discrete nod meant to convey that he had
come on business. Chester stopped to watch two guys playing pool in the back
room before exiting onto the patio beyond to smoke a cigarette.</a>
</p>

<p>
Chester
had taken only a couple of puffs when he heard Ricco loudly asking, &quot;Did
anyone see where the nutty professor went?&quot; He stuck his head back into
the light of the bar and waved to catch Ricco's eye.
</p>

<p>
Ricco
weaved rearward through the clumps of patrons to meet Chester outside.
&quot;Listen, professor, I don't have anything right now, but I want to take
care of my boy, so I'm going to call a friend.&quot;
</p>

<p>
With
a flourish he produced a cellphone from the pocket of his baggy shorts and
poked at its buttons with his thick fingers. He held it expectantly to his ear.
After a few seconds, he said, &quot;Yo, niggah, I'm at the Blue Moon. I need
you to get here right away.&quot;
</p>

<p>
He
shook his head in disgust at the reply from the other party. &quot;No, bitch,
fifteen minutes ain't gonna cut it--you better get your ass here in ten.&quot;
Then he snapped his phone shut. &quot;Fifteen minutes,&quot; he informed
Chester with a grin.
</p>

<p>
&quot;Fifteen
minutes is fine.&quot; Chester dropped the stub of his fag onto the cement at
his feet and stamped it out. &quot;I'll be inside.&quot;
</p>

<p>
He
had only slept for three or four hours the night before, and had spent most of
that day walking around town. He felt like he was about to collapse, so he
found a niche to occupy on one of the three leather couches near the bar. As he
scanned the scene around him he noticed a young, well-dressed couple, whom he
guessed had only been dating briefly, sitting on the sofa directly opposite and
perhaps ten feet away from his. They were deep in conversation, but they looked
up when Ricco appeared between the two couches a moment later, shouting a drink
order to the bartender. As Ricco waited for her to pour his beer, he turned to
Chester and proclaimed, &quot;I've gotta start a trial on Wednesday. I'm
looking at ten fucking years. What really sucks is that I didn't even fucking
do it. Shit, if I had popped somebody off&quot;--here he paused to make a
shooting gesture--&quot;I could do the time standing on my head, but I gotta
take a fall for some other shithead.&quot; Chester noted that the couple's
conversation had been totally de-railed, and they both were staring at Ricco
while trying to pretend that they simply had suddenly become enraptured by the
deer head mounted on the wall above this--apparently homicidal--maniac's
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Chester
rose from the leather cushions to get another beer himself. After he had
ordered, he told Ricco, &quot;That does suck. What's the charge?&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;Nah,
you don't even wanna know.&quot; Ricco took a gulp from his mug. &quot;Hey,
how's your new book coming?&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;I
should be done in a few months.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;You're
gonna bring me a copy, right?&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;Of
course.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;I
want it autographed.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;No
problem.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;That
way, I can waste you after you give it to me, and get a lot of dough for
it.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Chester
chuckled. Glancing over at the pair of eavesdroppers, he felt certain that they
had decided they had come to the wrong bar. He stared off at the ceiling as if
seriously evaluating Ricco's idea, and then said, in a deadpan voice, &quot;Not
a bad plan.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Ricco
wasn't quite sure what to make of that response. He put his beefy hands on
Chester's shoulders, shook them, and said, &quot;You know I'm just messing with
you, don't you? I would never do wrong by my boy.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Chester
laughed. &quot;Of course I know. And anyway, I'd fuck you up before you even
got a shot off.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Ricco
loved this, and put an arm over Chester's shoulder. Chester looked across the
room, but their audience had fled.

asked Rob, who's the maitre d' tonight, if he was aware that there was a naked

</p>

<p>
<b>T</b>: Stevie, what, you can't even say
&quot;Hello&quot; to your old friend? We used to hang out. Now that you've got
a restaurant that gets written up in <i>The New York Times</i>, you don't know
me anymore?
</p>

<p>
S: Tony, look, I just came in to have a
drink with my friends here. [He gestures at the people who are sitting near
him.] I didn't come here for a fight. So what do you say you go back to your
seat, and I'll stay here, and we'll leave each other alone?
</p>

<p>
<b>T</b>: So that's the way you treat an old
friend. &quot;Just leave me alone&quot;? Well, fuck you, and fuck your piece of
shit friends here.
</p>

<p>
[Jenna, the bartender, intervenes.]
</p>

<p>
J: Listen, Tony, we don't need a scene.
It's my fault: I served you a few too many. Look, that last round is on me;
just leave, and tomorrow we'll pretend this never happened.
</p>

<p>
<b>T</b>: Fuck you, too, Jenna. [Looks down
the bar at Chester.] You gonna let her treat me like this, after all the money
I've spent here?
</p>

<p>
<b>Chester</b> [looking nonplussed]: Tony, why
don't we just go somewhere else?
</p>

<p>
<b>T</b>: What? These assholes are dissing me.
You're not going to let them do that, are you?
</p>

<p>
<b>C</b>: Tony, we've had a lot to drink. Let's
just leave.
</p>

<p>
<b>T</b>: What the fuck? So you're on their
side? They can fucking treat me like I don't exist, and you're OK with that?
Well, fuck you too.
</p>

<p>
[Tony rolls out of the bar, giving
Chester the finger as he passes him.]

<p>
<b>Tony</b>:
You're a fucking shitty friend, you know that? Cause what friends do is, they
have each other's backs. And you're too chicken shit to have my back. When your
two-faced friends at the bar talk shit about me, behind my back, that they're
too big pussies to say to my face, you're supposed to stand up for me. But
you're a pussy just like them.</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Chester</b>: I'm a shitty
friend? Fuck that! It's you who's a shitty friend. The way your world works is
this: All of your so-called friends are expected to take your shit and your
insults everyday. Oh, but if one of them challenges you on it, or doesn't go
along with some fucked up move you've pulled? Then you fucking blow up at them.
Why do you think you're usually not talking to about half of your &quot;friends&quot;?
</p>

<p>
And you know why I didn't
stand up for you last night? Because the people talking shit about you were
fucking right, and you were wrong: You were acting like a dick. And I think a
real friend doesn't let someone get away with being a dick. What you want isn't
a friend: you want someone who will lick your ass clean for you.
</p>

<p>  
<b>Tony</b>: Yeah, you think so?
Well, don't bother coming to work tomorrow, cause you're fucking fired. You
never sold anything anyway, cause you're a pussy who can't close the deal. That's
why your wife fucking left you, and that's why, even though you're trying every
night, you never go home with anyone from the bars, ad wind up jerking off by
yourself: you can't close the deal. Pussy.

[<a name=FatefulMessage>Chester sits at
his computer, bleary-eyed. He is drinking many shots of vodka, snorting lines,
and fuming over his conversation with Tony.]</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Chester</b>: Fuck him, fuck him, fuck him.
He can't fucking treat me like that. [He is shaking, and nearly in tears.]
</p>

<p>
[Chester logs on to Facebook, finds the
page of Tony's wife, Gabriella, and clicks on &quot;Send Message.&quot; He
begins to type:
</p>

<p>
Just thought you might like to know
that your husband fools around on you all the time. I've been to strip clubs and
massage parlors with him, and watched him pick up sleazy chicks at bars and
take them back to the car dealership to fuck them. I just can't stand it
anymore, knowing that a loving wife like you is being betrayed like this by
him. I know hearing this may hurt, but I felt you needed to know the truth.]
</p>

<p>
Chester [Mouses over the
&quot;Send&quot; button, then hesitates. He puts his hands over his eyes for a
moment. Then he looks back up at the screen.]: I was your fucking friend. I'll
show you who's a pussy. [He clicks &quot;Send.&quot; Then he takes a huge swig
of vodka straight from the bottle, and, a moment later, passes out in the chair
in front of the computer.]

[<a

Chester's face as he snores, still slumped in the chair in front of his
computer. Slowly, he stirs. He rubs his face, opens his eyes, and looks around
to get his bearings. A look of worry comes across his face. He remembers the
message of the previous night. He checks to see if he really sent the message.
He finds he did. He slumps to the floor.]</a>

[<a name=TonyCallsChester>Chester is
laying in bed, staring out the window towards Manhattan. His phone rings. He
picks it up, and sees it is Tony calling. He hesitates, but then answers, but
remains silent.]</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>T</b>: Chester, you there?
</p>

<p>
<b>C</b>: Yeah?
</p>

<p>
<b>T</b>: Listen, this has gotten too fucked
up. We were friends. We've got to work this out.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
[<a name=TheFinalConfrontation>Chester
sits in the same corner of the bar where he first met Tony?. He is drinking a
vodka and tonic, looking a little tipsy and a little uneasy. He engages in
small talk with the bartender. The door opens behind him, and Tony walks in,
with his son's little league baseball bat in his hand. He rushes at Chester.]</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony</b>: You stupid mother-fucking cunt!
[He raises the bat and whacks Chester, who has lifted his arms to protect his
head.] I gave you a job! [He continues to swing the bat as he shouts. Art has
leaped onto the bar, and then down as he tries to separate the two men.] I took
you into my family! [Tony now is swinging around Art, and Chester is beginning
to crumple under the blows.] I made you a part of this neighborhood! [Tony continues
to fight his way around Art to get at Chester. Chester is now bleeding from
several places on his head, and has fallen off of his barstool, and is
half-sitting, half-slumped over on the floor.]
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony</b>: And you, you stupid fucking cunt,
you thank me by wrecking my family. My wife and kids are gone, and you are
going to pay for that!
</p>

<p>
[A couple of patrons join Art in
attempting to restrain Tony, who continues to struggle to land blows on
Chester. Another patron is on his cellphone, and is shouting, &quot;Send a squad
car here right away.&quot; Finally, the combined forces of Art and the
assisting patrons drag Tony to the floor and pin him down. He struggles for a
minute, but then goes limp, and begins to sob.]
</p>

<p>
<b>T</b>: He fucking ruined my life. He
deserves what I gave him and more.
</p>

<p>
[The police arrive. They grab Tony,
push his face into the floor, and handcuff him. They yank him up and drag him
out through the bar door. We see their red and blue lights flashing into the
bar through the window.
</p>

<p>
Chester remains slumped on the floor,
bloody, staring blankly towards the ceiling, a tear running down his cheek.
</p>

<p>
We fade to the credits.]
